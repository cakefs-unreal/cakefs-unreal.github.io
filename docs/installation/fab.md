## Installing the Cake IO plugin from the Fab 
Once you have installed Cake IO from Fab to the correct Unreal Engine version, only a few steps are required to integrate it into your projects.

From the Unreal Editor, select Plugins from the Edit menu.

{{ img_install_fab('Opening the Plugins window', 'open-plugin-window') }}

From the Plugins window, either either type "Cake IO" in the search bar or navigate to it via the categories `Installed / Engine Tools`.

{{ img_install_fab('Locating the Cake IO Plugin', 'locating-plugin') }}

Click the checkbox next to the Cake IO icon to enable the plugin for this project.

{{ img_install_fab('Enabling the Cake IO Plugin', 'enabling-plugin') }}

Once enabled, you will need to restart the Unreal Editor. Once the editor restarts, you are ready to start using Cake IO in your project!
