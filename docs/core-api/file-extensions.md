## Introduction
CakeIO offers FileExtension objects to enforce a standard representation of file extensions as well as to offer a variety of utilities involving file extension classification and manipulation. The standard representation enforced by the objects mean we no longer have to care about remembering whether or not our extensions require a leading '.' character. The FileExtension objects will handle that for us, and as a bonus they will also sanitize and fix malformed extension inputs like `.src..txt` => `.src.txt`.

=== "C++"
    The native file extension object in CakeIO is **FCakeFileExt**. 
    
    **FCakeFileExt** is defined in `CakeFileExt.h`, and all code examples will assume the following include:

    ``` c++
    #include "CakeIO/CakeFileExt.h"
    ```

=== "Blueprint"
    The Blueprint File Extension object is **UCakeFileExt**. It is defined in `Blueprint/CakeFileExt_BP.h`:
    ``` c++
    #include "CakeIO/Blueprint/CakeFileExt_BP.h"
    ```

## File Extension Classification
Before we look at the File Extension object interface, it is important to understand how CakeIO classifies file extensions. CakeIO defines two distinct types of file extension: **single** file extensions and **multi** file extensions.
> **Single File Extension**: A file extension that contains only one file extension component: e.g., `.txt` or `.bin`

> **Multi File Extension**: A file extension that contains more than one file extension component: e.g., `.cdr.txt` or `.bin.dat.zip`

CakeIO represents file extension types via the enum **ECakeFileExtType**. File extensions that are empty will have the value `None`, file extensions with one component will be assigned the value `Single`, and file extensions with more than one component will have the value `Multi`.


=== "C++"

    ```c++ 
    auto EmptyExt  = ECakeFileExtType::None;
    auto SingleExt = ECakeFileExtType::Single;
    auto MultiExt  = ECakeFileExtType::Multi;
    ```

## Basic Usage
### Building File Extension Objects
=== "C++"
    To build an **FCakeFileExt** object, we can use the constructor which takes an **FStringView** that represents the file extension we want to store.

    ```c++
	FCakeFileExt TextExt  { TEXTVIEW(".txt") };
	FCakeFileExt BinaryExt{ TEXTVIEW("bin")  };
    ```

    Because **FCakeFileExt** enforces a standard representation of file extensions, it doesn't matter if we supply the leading extension dot '.' when submitting an extension string.

    --8<-- "ad-stringview.md"

    To create an **FCakeFileExt** by extracting the file extension from a file name, we can use the static function `BuildFileExtFromFilePath`:

    ```c++ hl_lines="3"
	FCakePath FileReadme{ TEXTVIEW("data/example_file.txt") };

	FCakeFileExt ExtFromFile{ FCakeFileExt::BuildFileExtFromFilePath(FileReadme) };
    ```
    --8<-- "warn-file-ext-extractions.md"

    We can create copies of a pre-existing **FCakeFileExt** through the copy constructor or the member function `Clone`:

    ```c++ hl_lines="3 4"
	FCakeFileExt TextExt{ TEXTVIEW(".txt") };

	FCakeFileExt TextCopy { TextExt         };
	FCakeFileExt TextClone{ TextExt.Clone() };
    ```

    If we want a clone of the **FCakeFileExt**'s string only, we can use the member function `CloneFileExtString`:

    ```c++ hl_lines="3"
	FCakeFileExt TextExt{ TEXTVIEW(".txt") };

	FString TextString{ TextExt.CloneFileExtString() };
    ```

=== "Blueprint"
    To build a new File Extension object, we use `BuildCakeFileExt`, submitting a string which represents the file extension the object should represent:

    {{ bp_img_file_ext('Build Cake File Ext') }}

    !!! note
        It doesn't matter if we include the leading `.` character for our file extension input arguments.

    If we want to build an empty File Extension object, we can use `BuildCakeFileExtEmpty`:

    {{ bp_img_file_ext('Build Cake File Ext Empty') }}

    When we have a file path, we can extract its extension into a File Extension object via `BuildCakeFileExt FromFilePath`:

    {{ bp_img_file_ext('Build Cake File Ext From File Path') }}

    --8<-- "warn-file-ext-extractions.md"


    To create a duplicate File Extension object, use `Clone`:

    {{ bp_img_file_ext('Clone') }}

    If we just need the file extension duplicated as a string, we can use `CloneFileExtString`:

    {{ bp_img_file_ext('Clone File Ext String') }}


### Reading the File Extension String
=== "C++"
    To read the file extension string, we can use either `operator*` or `GetFileExtString`:

    ```c++ hl_lines="6-7"
	auto LogExt = [](const FString& ExtStr) 
		{ UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Extension String: [%s]"), *ExtStr); };

	FCakeFileExt TextExt  { TEXTVIEW(".txt") };

	LogExt(*TextExt);
	LogExt( TextExt.GetFileExtString() );
    ```
=== "Blueprint"
    To read the file extension as a string, we use `GetFileExtString`:

    {{ bp_img_file_ext('Get File Ext String') }}

### Changing the File Extension
=== "C++"
    We have many ways to change the file extension of a pre-existing **FCakeFileExt**. To change the extension string to another string that represents a file extension, we can use the member function `SetFileExt`.

    ```c++ hl_lines="3"
	FCakeFileExt SourceExt{ TEXTVIEW(".txt") };

	SourceExt.SetFileExt( TEXTVIEW("bin.dat") ); // => ".bin.dat"
    ```
    --8<-- "warn-file-ext-set-versus-extract.md"

    To copy the file extension from another **FCakeFileExt** object, we can use the member function `SetFileExtViaOther`:

    ```c++ hl_lines="4"
    FCakeFileExt SourceExt  { TEXTVIEW(".txt")     };
	FCakeFileExt GameSaveExt{ TEXTVIEW(".sav.dat") };

	SourceExt.SetFileExtViaOther(GameSaveExt);
    ```

    To steal the file extension from another **FCakeFileExt** object, we can use the member function `StealFileExt`:

    ```c++ hl_lines="4"
	FCakeFileExt SourceExt  { TEXTVIEW(".txt")     };
	FCakeFileExt GameSaveExt{ TEXTVIEW(".sav.dat") };

	SourceExt.StealFileExt(MoveTemp(GameSaveExt));
    ```

    To change the file extension to be the extraction result from a file path, we can use the member function `SetFileExtFromFilePath`:

    ```c++ hl_lines="4"
	FCakeFileExt SourceExt{ TEXTVIEW(".txt")                    };
	FCakePath    ItemsDb  { TEXTVIEW("/y/data/assets/items.db") };

	SourceExt.SetFileExtFromFilePath(ItemsDb); // => ".db"
    ```


    --8<-- "ad-copymove-ctor.md"

    We can check if an **FCakeFileExt** holds any file extension via the member function `IsEmpty`:

    ```c++ hl_lines="4"
	FCakeFileExt SourceExt{ TEXTVIEW(".txt")     };

	SourceExt.Reset();
	const bool IsEmpty{ SourceExt.IsEmpty() }; // => true
    ```

    To clear any existing file extension from an **FCakeFileExt** object, we can use the member function `Reset`:

    ```c++ hl_lines="3"
	FCakeFileExt SourceExt{ TEXTVIEW(".txt")     };

	SourceExt.Reset();
    ```

    `Reset` takes an optional parameter that can reserve a new size for the internal `FString` that will hold the file extension string:

    ```c++ hl_lines="4"
	FCakeFileExt SourceExt{ TEXTVIEW(".txt")     };
	FCakeFileExt ExtMulti { TEXTVIEW(".cdr.txt") };

	SourceExt.Reset( ExtMulti.GetExtString().Len() );

	SourceExt.SetFileExtViaOther(ExtMulti);
	const bool IsEmpty{ SourceExt.IsEmpty() }; // => false
    ```
    --8<-- "note-reset-forwarding.md"

=== "Blueprint"
    To change the file extension of an existing FileExtension object, we use `SetFileExt`:

    {{ bp_img_file_ext('Set File Ext') }}

    --8<-- "warn-file-ext-set-versus-extract.md"

    To change the file extension to another FileExtension object's extension, we use `SetFileExtViaOther`:

    {{ bp_img_file_ext('Set File Ext Via Other') }}

    To change the file extension to a file path's file extension, we use `SetFileExtFromFilePath`:

    {{ bp_img_file_ext('Set File Ext From File Path') }}

    --8<-- "warn-file-ext-extractions.md"

    To see if a FileExtension object's file extension is empty, we use `Is Empty`:

    {{ bp_img_file_ext('is-empty') }}

    To clear an existing FileExtension object's file extension back to empty, we use `Reset`:

    {{ bp_img_file_ext('reset') }}

    --8<-- "note-bp-newreservedsize.md"

### Combining File Extensions
=== "C++"
    We can build combined extensions with the member function `operator+`:

    ```c++ hl_lines="4"
	FCakeFileExt ExtTxt{ TEXTVIEW(".txt") };
	FCakeFileExt ExtCdr{ TEXTVIEW(".cdr") };

	FCakeFileExt ExtCdrTxt{ ExtCdr + ExtTxt }; // => ".cdr.txt"
    ```
    We can also alternatively use the member function `Combine` if we prefer:

    ```c++ hl_lines="4"
	FCakeFileExt ExtTxt{ TEXTVIEW(".txt") };
	FCakeFileExt ExtCdr{ TEXTVIEW(".cdr") };

	FCakeFileExt ExtCdrTxt{ ExtCdr.Combine(ExtTxt) }; // => ".cdr.txt"
    ```

    To append a file extension onto a pre-existing **FCakeFileExt** object, we can use either member function `operator+=` or `CombineInline`:

    ```cpp
    FCakeFileExt ExtSrc   { TEXTVIEW(".txt")     };
    FCakeFileExt ExtCdr   { TEXTVIEW(".cdr")     };
    FCakeFileExt ExtBinDat{ TEXTVIEW(".bin.dat") };

    ExtSrc += ExtCdr; // => ".txt.cdr"
    ExtSrc.CombineInline(ExtBinDat); // => ".txt.cdr.bin.dat"
    ```

=== "Blueprint"
    To create a new FileExtension object that combines the extensions of two FileExtension objects, we use `Combine`:

    {{ bp_img_file_ext('Combine') }}

    To append one FileExtension object's extension directly to another FileExtension object, we use `CombineInline`:

    {{ bp_img_file_ext('Combine Inline') }}


### Comparing File Extensions
=== "C++"
    We can use equality comparison against **FCakeFileExt** objects via member functions `operator==` and `operator!=`. 

    ```c++ hl_lines="4-5"
	FCakeFileExt ExtA{ TEXTVIEW(".txt") };
	FCakeFileExt ExtB{ TEXTVIEW(".cdr") };

	const bool bIsEqual   { ExtA == ExtB }; // => false
	const bool bIsNotEqual{ ExtA != ExtB }; // => true
    ```

=== "Blueprint"
    To check if one FileExtension object is equal to another, we use `Is Equal To`:

    {{ bp_img_file_ext('Is Equal To') }}

    To check if one FileExtension object is not equal to another, we use `Is Not Equal To`:

    {{ bp_img_file_ext('Is Not Equal To') }}

### Classifying a File Extension
We can get the [file extension classification](#file-extension-classification) of a CakeFileExt via `ClassifyFileExt`, which returns the corresponding file extension type as an ECakeFileExtType enum value:
=== "C++"

    ```c++ hl_lines="5-7"
	FCakeFileExt ExtNone  {};
	FCakeFileExt ExtSingle{ TEXTVIEW(".txt")     };
	FCakeFileExt ExtMulti { TEXTVIEW(".cdr.txt") };

	ECakeFileExtType ExtType{ ExtNone.ClassifyFileExt() }; // => None
	ExtType = ExtSingle.ClassifyFileExt(); // => Single
	ExtType = ExtMulti.ClassifyFileExt(); // => Multi
    ```
=== "Blueprint"
    {{ bp_img_file_ext('Classify File Ext') }}

## Advanced Usage
### Viewing a File Extension in Single form
There are situations where it can be valuable to only assess a file extension's trailing component, regardless as to whether the actual file extension's type is multi or single. There are various utility methods to support this operation.

When we want to view the trailing extension of an existing FileExt object, we use `CloneSingle`:
=== "C++"

    ```c++ hl_lines="4-5"
    FCakeFileExt ExtSingle{ TEXTVIEW(".txt")     };
	FCakeFileExt ExtMulti { TEXTVIEW(".cdr.txt") };

	FCakeFileExt ClonedSingle{ ExtSingle.CloneSingle() }; // => ".txt"
	ClonedSingle = ExtMulti.CloneSingle(); // => ".txt"
    ```
=== "Blueprint"
    {{ bp_img_file_ext('Clone Single') }}

    In the example above, the cloned CakeFileExt will have the extension `.txt`.

!!! note
    `CloneAsSingle` will always return the trailing component on a file extension (assuming there is one), so it is safe to use on both single and multi extensions. This means that `CloneAsSingle` is a valuable tool when you are processing file extensions and only care about examining the trailing extension component, regardless of your source extension's actual number of extension components.

### Extracting a File Extension in Single Form
Sometimes we want to just extract the trailing component from a filename. There is a special build function we can use to accomplish this goal.
=== "C++"
    We can extract just the trailing extension component from a file name via the static function `BuildFileExtFromFilePathSingle`:
    ```c++ hl_lines="4"
	FCakePath SecretItemsDb{ TEXTVIEW("/x/game/data/secret/items.bin.db") };

	FCakeFileExt SingleFromFilePath{ 
		FCakeFileExt::BuildFileExtFromFilePathSingle(SecretItemsDb) 
	}; // => ".db"
    ```
=== "Blueprint"
    To build a FileExt object that contains just the trailing component (assuming there is one) of a file extension, we use `BuildCakeFileExtFromFilePathSingle`:

    {{ bp_img_file_ext('Build Cake File Ext From File Path Single') }}

In the example above, the CakeFileExt will have the extension `.db`.
