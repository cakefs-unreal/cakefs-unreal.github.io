# API Overview
Welcome to the API documentation for CakeFS! Here we will go over a brief summary of each of the sections provided here.

## Platform Support
Right now the only officially supported platform is Windows; however, the entire library is written against Unreal Engine's cross-platform IO / filesystem APIs. Technically CakeFS should work as is with any platform that Unreal's APIs support, but we do not have the resources to support these platforms officially. We will look to expand the number of officially supported platforms in the future.

## Core Objects
This section of the API covers the most important CakeFS objects and their general usage. Users who are brand new to CakeFS should start here to gain familiarity with the main objects of CakeFS.

## Error Handling
This section gives an overview of how error reporting works in CakeFS as well as effective error handling strategies. Once you are familiar with CakeFile and CakeDir objects and their associated filesystem operations, this section will give you guidance in how to deal with the outcomes these operations can generate.

## Fundamental Types
This section covers simple, primitive types that are consumed and generated by higher level CakeFS interfaces. This section is best used as a reference; you will be directed here as necessary by the other sections.
