!!! warning 
    The following traversal examples show only minimal error handling to keep the focus on core usage. While there is nothing inherently wrong with this minimal error handling style, do not view it as a recommendation! See [Error Handling](../core-api/error-handling.md#traversal-error-handling) for a detailed examination of traversal error handling strategies.
