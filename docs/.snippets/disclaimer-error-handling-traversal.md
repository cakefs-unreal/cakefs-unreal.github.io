!!! warning 
    The following traversal examples show only minimal error handling; this is to keep the focus on core traversal interface usage and reduce the complexity of the example code. While there is nothing inherently wrong with this minimal error handling style, do not view it as a recommendation! See [Error Handling](../core-api/error-handling.md#traversal-error-handling) for a detailed examination of traversal error types and error handling strategies.
